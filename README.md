This Django project is a simple messaging application allowing users to sign up, log in, add friends, and exchange messages with each other in real-time.
Users can sign up with unique usernames, log in securely, and add friends to their contact list.
The main interface displays a list of contacts and a chatbox where users can select a friend to chat with and exchange messages instantly.
The application utilizes AJAX for dynamic updating of the contact list and chat messages without refreshing the page.
It provides a seamless and interactive messaging experience for users to communicate effectively.
